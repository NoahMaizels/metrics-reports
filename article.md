## Total Reachable Full Nodes Regardless of Active Status

This metric has been recorded since May, 2024, and it reports the total number of unique reachable full nodes, regardless of whether or not they have issued a commit transaction within the month. This metric can help offer a fuller picture of network activity, as some minority of nodes will be actively operating in neighbourhoods which were not chosen to play the redistribution game during the month (it may also however potentially represent an over-count of nodes, as it records even nodes which were only reachable momentarily at one point during the month).

In May there were unique full nodes with reserve size greater than zero which were reachable at least once throughout the month.

| Month     | Total Reachable Full Nodes |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| May       | 16,000                     |
| June      | 18,916                     |
| July      |  20,898                  |
## Total Winning Nodes by Month
